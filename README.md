## 📌 Tasks Completed

### Level 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed basic data exploration on the Iris dataset
- Checked dataset structure, summary statistics, and missing values
- Visualized data using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots

### Level 2: K-Means Clustering
- Applied K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset
- Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots

## Level 3: Classification
- Built a classification model using Logistic Regression
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
